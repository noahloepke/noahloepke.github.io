## About Me

Hi, my name is Noah! One of my biggest passions is nature, which is why I spend most of my time outdoors, even when coding! My favorite outdoor hobbies include hiking, tennis, archery, and skating. While relaxing inside however, I enjoy reading books, playing video games, and tinkering with various programs on my computer. Technology has always fascinated me and the rapidly changing industry keeps me on my toes constantly.
